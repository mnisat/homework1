        <h2>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h2>

        <p>
          I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite
          holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my
          favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite
          Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list,
          I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
